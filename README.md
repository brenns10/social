Meta-Social Network Expander
============================

This project is (going to be) a creepy tool that takes one of someone's social
network accounts, and attempts to expand it into a list of all of their
accounts, using publicly available information.  Hopefully the output will be
something like this:

```bash
$ social_expander github:brenns10
GitHubAccount: brenns10
PersonalWebsite: stephen-brennan.com
TwitterAccount: brenns10
# ... etc ...
```
