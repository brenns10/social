   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Social's documentation!
==================================

Social is a Python tool for being creepy and taking advantage of the information
a person has made public about themselves.  It can:

- Link together people's social networking profiles.
- Gather demographic information about a person as it links these profiles.

It has a plugin-based design that makes it easy to extend with new types of
social networking sites.  I will gladly accept pull requests for new social
networking sites at the GitHub `repository`_ -- see the "contributing" section
for more details.
